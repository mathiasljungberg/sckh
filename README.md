Programs for calculation of XAS and XES including vibrational effects

Working codes:

KH    - quantum mechanical solution of the Kramers-Heisenberg equations for vibrational effects in XES
SCKH  - semiclassical solution of the KH equations for XES
*sinc_DVR  - solution of 1d vibrational problem on a grid with a sinc DVR
*DVR_PO  - potential optimized DV
*Kramers-Heisenberg_resonant - like KH but for the resonant case (in the SCKH_resonant folder)

* these codes lack a logical build sequence right now...

Codes under development:

XAS_nonadiabatic  - XAS and XAS including nonadiabatic effects. Also attempt to unify codes into one
SCKH_resonant  - like SCKH but for the reoannt case
