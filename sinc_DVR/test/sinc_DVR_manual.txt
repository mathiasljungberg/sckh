Manual for the program sinc_DVR

This program calculates the vibrational frequencies of a one dimensional problem using the sinc DVR method.


How to compile the program
******************************

We need a fortran 90 compiler like pgf90. All necessary subroutines are included except blas and lapack. See makefile. 


How to run the program
*****************************
we need:

1) inputfile (sinc_DVR.inp in this example)
2) file with potential energy surface (initial_PES_spline.dat in this example)


run it like

sinc_DVR < sinc_DVR.inp > out

 
Main input file (sinc_DVR.inp)
***********************************
the input file is read like:

  read(5,*) pes_file
  read(5,*) npoints_in
  read(5,*) nstates, dvr_start, dx 
  read(5,*) my

  ! pes_file: the file with the potential energy surface, in Angstroms and Hartree units
  ! npoints_in; the number of points in pes_file
  ! nstates: the number of dvr points, and the number of eigenstates
  ! dvr_start: the atarting dvr point, in Angstroms
  ! dx: the spacing betwen dvr points, in Angstroms
  ! my: reduced mass, in atomic units


Other Input files
***********************************

The pes_file is read like this

  do i=1,npoints_in
     read(10,*) x_in(i), E_in(i)
  end do

x_in: position [A]
E_in: energy [Hartree]

Example:
**************
sinc_DVR.inp:

initial_PES_spline.dat
295
295 0.8 0.1
0.972222222222222


output looks like following:

qcllx22:~/fortranfiler/Wave_packet_dynamics/sinc_DVR/test$ ../sinc_DVR < sinc_DVR.inp
