To install the SCKH codes CMake, BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW are required.

To build, create a build directory, cd to it and type

> cmake path_to_source

where path_to_source is the path to the src directory. Now cmake tries to set up your system, if it doesn't work,
you can pass arguments, most commonly CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER, LAPACK_LIB, FFTW_LIB by typing

> cmake -Doption=something path_to_source

Another option is to add an architecture option in CMakeLists.txt in src. Be sure not to break anything though.
When cmake has succesfully set up you can type

> make

or, if you only want to build a specific excecutable, for example sckh_main,

> make sckh_main

To run the tests, copy the whole sckh/test/testsuite folder to a temporary folder, and cd to it. Then type

> SCKH_PATH=path_to_buld; python run_tests.py

path_to build is the path to the build directory.
